# Add Pre-Commit Hooks

In order for the committees to follow the format `DJ-<TASK_NUMBER>: <COMMIT_MESSAGE>`

A script has been added that checks the format of the committees. 

If the format is not saved, the committee will be rejected.

# Checking the code format:

To revise Python code, `ruff` is used. 
Before each cut, the linter starts and checks the code's consistency. 

If the code does not support the benefits, the committee will be eliminated.

##  How to install:

```
pip install pre-commit ruff
Initialize pre-commit on your repository: (pre-commit install)
```
